# Poltek Visit App

An interactive iOS application that showcases cuttingâ€‘edge Apple platform technologies (SwiftUI, Vision, CoreML, ARKit, CoreNFC) while guiding visiting student teams through a crossâ€‘cultural scavenger hunt. Originally built for a joint Singapore Polytechnic & Indonesian learner workshop, this app mixes realâ€‘time sensor demos with culturally themed puzzles.

## Why This App Exists

1. **Handsâ€‘on Tech Showcase**  
   Demonstrate realâ€‘world usage of Vision (pose detection), CoreML (action & image classification), SoundAnalysis (audio recognition), ARKit (motion classification), and CoreNFC (tag reading) within a single SwiftUI experience, and to promote cross cultrue relations

2. **Crossâ€‘Cultural Engagement**  
   Bring together 150 students (70 Singaporean, 80 Indonesian) through collaborative, locationâ€‘based puzzles that reveal heritage and cultural facts as teams unlock each clue.

3. **Scalable Selfâ€‘Guided Experience**  
   Support large groups on their own devices without constant instructor oversight, using persistent state and clear feedback to keep everyone on track.
